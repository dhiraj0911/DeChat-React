## Inspiration
Social Media platforms shape public discourse by extracting massive amounts of data from the people that use them, applying them to drive dark patterns of addictive engagement with the goal of selling user attention to marketers and advertisers. What makes these social media so powerful is their organization around central rule-making authorities and data repositories, which leaves users ripe for exploitation. But rather than simply critique these platforms, we should apply their lessons to new technologies like Decentralization using Blockchain

## What it does
Our Application Decentragram based on Instagram Application. That Share Images and Messages Like Instagram, We are working on Video Sharing too.
